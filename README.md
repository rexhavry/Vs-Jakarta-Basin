# Vs-Jakarta-Basin

We develop a new 3-D model of Jakarta Basinâ€™s shallow shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure and improve on previous models that did not cover the basin edge due to the extent ofdata coverage. The study is published in <b>Ry <i>et al.</i> (2023, GJI)</b>

The Vs model is provided in the excel file. </p>
